#  This is a sample control file using the general FCC mobility and
#  the FMM for far-field forces to simulate dislocations in a sample
#  of copper.  This examples runs on 8 processors and requires
#  the FMM correction table fm-ctab.Cu.m2.t5.dat.  If the
#  correction table has not been provided in the "inputs" directory,
#  See the description of 'ctablegen' in the 'Tools' section of
#  the ParaDiS User's Guide for information on generating correction tables.
#
#  Output generated by this example will be placed under the directory
#  specified by the <dirname> value and includes:

#    gnuplot visualization files
#    various properties files
#    segment velocity files
